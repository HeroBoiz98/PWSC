                <p class="leading-relaxed">Hey User, Micorosft Recently Released Windows 11 on 5 october 2021!If You are Unknown to Windows 11,it is All New Windows released By Microsoft. so as per windows 11 is with all new UI and features. This Time Windows 11 Has mainly focused on security, if you want high protection windows 11 is prefered but, if you do programming or you are editor it is not preffered because windows 11 compress some feature of external apps! All Though If u are a daily worker it is highly reccomend to use windows 10 and you are short time user you can use windows with some external setting.All Though my Rating Is 8.5/10 </p>
